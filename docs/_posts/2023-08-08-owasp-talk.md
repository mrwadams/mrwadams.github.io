## Introduction

Generative AI is undeniably shaping the future of technology, and its implications in cybersecurity are both vast and transformative. I had the privilege of sharing my insights on this topic at the OWASP London Chapter Meeting on August 3rd, 2023. My talk, titled "Doing More with Less: Practical Applications for Generative AI in Cybersecurity," aimed to shed light on the real-world applications of this groundbreaking technology.

## Key Insights from My Talk

- **Generative AI as a Productivity Multiplier:** One of the main points I emphasised was the role of generative AI as a productivity enhancer for cybersecurity teams. With the right tools, we can achieve more without necessarily expanding our resources.
- **Live Demonstrations:** I showcased three live demos to give attendees a firsthand look at AI-powered tools in action. These tools have the potential to autonomously generate threat models, craft security awareness materials, and even automate security scanning and reporting.
- **Ideation and Implementation:** I encouraged everyone to think about their unique use cases and how generative AI can fit into their operations. Drawing from my experiences, I also shared some best practices for implementing generative AI effectively.
- **Generative AI in the News:** While I didn't delve into an introductory course on generative AI, I acknowledged its growing presence in the media. I also highlighted the recent release of the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs as a must-read for those keen on understanding the security risks associated with large language models.

## Wrapping Up

The potential of generative AI to redefine the cybersecurity arena is immense. Through my talk at the OWASP London Chapter Meeting, I hoped to inspire fellow professionals to delve deeper into this technology and harness its capabilities.
