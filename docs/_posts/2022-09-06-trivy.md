# Overview
The purpose of this post is to document the key steps required to install and run [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy) to fit my workflow for performing vulnerability scans of container images.

# Installation
Follow [these instructions](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.31.3/getting-started/installation/) to add Trivy repository to a Debian/Ubuntu machine's list of `apt` sources and install the tool.

# Image Scans
The following command runs Trivy against a target container image and will return a table of vulnerability findings.

```bash
trivy image [TARGET_IMAGE_NAME]
```

## Useful Flags

| **Flag**                    | **Description**                                                         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--reset`                   | Remove previously downloaded vulnerability data from the Trivy database |
| `--output`                  | Specify the output file name                                            |
| `--format`                  | Specify the output format (default=table)                               |
| `--severity HIGH,CRITICAL` | Return only HIGH and CRITICAL severity vulnerabilities                  |


# Periodic Scanning
I have a number of containers deployed in my homelab that I would like to periodically scan with Trivy in order to understand what known vulnerabilities exist for them. Rather than repeatedly typing `trivy image...` commands, I put together the following script to run multiple scans with one command.

Whenever I deploy a new container I simply update this script to include the container image for scanning.

In future I could schedule this script to be run regularly using `cron`, but for now that's not necessary.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Scanning uptime-kuma..."
echo " "
trivy image louislam/uptime-kuma:1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --output uptime-kuma-results
echo " "
echo "Scan results saved to uptime-kuma-results"
echo "---------------------------------------------"

echo " "
echo "Scanning heimdall..."
echo " "
trivy image lscr.io/linuxserver/heimdall:latest --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --output heimdall-results
echo " "
echo "Scan results saved to heimdall-results"
echo "---------------------------------------------"

echo " "
echo "Scanning portainer..."
echo " "
trivy image portainer/portainer-ce:latest --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --output portainer-results
echo " "
echo "Scan results saved to portainer-results"
echo "---------------------------------------------"

echo " "
echo "Scanning guacamole..."
echo " "
trivy image oznu/guacamole:latest --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --output guacamole-results
echo " "
echo "Scan results saved to guacamole-results"
echo "---------------------------------------------"

echo " "
echo "Scanning wikijs..."
echo " "
trivy image linuxserver/wikijs:latest --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --output wikijs-results
echo " "
echo "Scan results saved to wikijs-results"
echo "---------------------------------------------"

echo " "
echo "Scanning complete, launching web server..."
echo " "
python3 -m http.server 8001
```

![Trivy Scan Script Output](/trivy-scan-output.png)

At the end of the script a local webserver is launched on the host to enable the results files to be viewed / downloaded from another machine on the network.
