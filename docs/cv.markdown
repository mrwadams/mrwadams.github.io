I'm a CISSP and CCSP certified Enterprise Security Architect, expert in designing, assessing and implementing cyber security solutions to safeguard business critical assets. My key strengths include: architecting robust security solutions, incorporating a defence in depth approach to designing security controls in line with clients’ requirements; ability to think strategically and obtain buy-in from senior stakeholders; and extensive experience of defining and delivering security improvement programmes to achieve a step change in organisational cyber security maturity levels.

I have a genuine passion for cyber security, technology and innovation. Outside of work I run a hybrid-cloud home lab environment, which I use for testing and deepening my understanding of containerisation, DevSecOps tooling, IoT projects and other things that spark my interest. I'm also an active participant in a number of bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure programmes.
