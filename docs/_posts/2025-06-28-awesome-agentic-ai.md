## Introduction

This is a curated list of high-quality resources for building and understanding agentic AI systems. Inspired by GitHub's "awesome" lists, this collection includes tutorials, guides, and practical frameworks that I've found particularly valuable for developing AI agents.

## Video Tutorials

### Building Effective Agents with LangGraph

From LangChain's Interrupt conference, David Odomirok and Zheng Xue from JP Morgan Chase Private Bank demonstrate "Ask David" - a sophisticated multi-agent AI system that automates investment research for thousands of financial products. This enterprise-grade system showcases how to build AI agents with human oversight for high-stakes financial decisions involving billions in assets.

## Written Guides

### Building Effective Agents - Anthropic
**Link**: [https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents)

Anthropic's engineering guide on building effective AI agents. This resource provides insights from the creators of Claude on agent design patterns, common pitfalls, and architectural considerations.

### A Practical Guide to Building Agents - OpenAI
**Link**: [https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/a-practical-guide-to-building-agents.pdf](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/a-practical-guide-to-building-agents.pdf)

OpenAI's practical guide offering a business-oriented perspective on building AI agents. This PDF covers use cases, implementation strategies, and considerations for deploying agents in production environments.

## Security & Threat Modeling Frameworks

### An Introduction to Google's Approach for Secure AI Agents
**Link**: [https://research.google/pubs/an-introduction-to-googles-approach-for-secure-ai-agents/](https://research.google/pubs/an-introduction-to-googles-approach-for-secure-ai-agents/)

Google Research presents an aspirational framework for building secure AI agents based on three core principles: well-defined human controllers, carefully limited powers, and observable actions. The paper advocates for a defense-in-depth strategy combining traditional deterministic security controls with dynamic reasoning-based defenses, aiming to develop AI agents that are powerful, useful, and secure by default.

### MAESTRO: Agentic AI Threat Modeling Framework - Cloud Security Alliance
**Link**: [https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2025/02/06/agentic-ai-threat-modeling-framework-maestro](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2025/02/06/agentic-ai-threat-modeling-framework-maestro)

MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment, Security, Threat, Risk, and Outcome) is a comprehensive threat modeling framework specifically designed for Agentic AI systems. Built on a seven-layer reference architecture, it helps security engineers and AI developers proactively identify and mitigate risks unique to autonomous AI agents, including goal misalignment, adversarial attacks, and agent-to-agent interaction vulnerabilities.

### Agentic AI Threats and Mitigations - OWASP
**Link**: [https://genai.owasp.org/resource/agentic-ai-threats-and-mitigations/](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/agentic-ai-threats-and-mitigations/)

OWASP's comprehensive resource exploring key threats and mitigation strategies for agentic AI. This guide focuses on security measures to address vulnerabilities in AI applications and their potential risks, providing practical guidance for developers and security professionals working with autonomous AI systems.

## Tools & Applications

### LangGraph Flow Designer
**GitHub**: [https://github.com/mrwadams/langgraph-flow-designer](https://github.com/mrwadams/langgraph-flow-designer)  
**Live App**: [https://langgraph-flow-designer.vercel.app/](https://langgraph-flow-designer.vercel.app/)

A visual flow designer I created for building and managing LangGraph workflows. This interactive tool provides a drag-and-drop interface for designing complex graph-based AI workflows, featuring grid snap alignment, multiple node types (regular, START, END, subgraph), conditional edge connections, and JSON export/import capabilities. Built with React and Vite, it simplifies the process of designing sophisticated AI agent workflows by providing an intuitive visual development environment.
